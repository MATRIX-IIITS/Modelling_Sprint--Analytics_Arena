# Modelling_Sprint--Analytics_Arena
Problem Statement and instructions for solution submission - Modelling Sprint ( The final eliminator round of Analytics Arena )

## Challenge Description:

Malware has been on the rise recently and there have been many methods to detect them on the basis of the size of the packets exchanged and the time period of the established connection along with a myriad of other features. You are required to create a classification model which takes in all of this network data and correctly classify the connection as Benign or if it is a malware, classify it as SMS Malware, Scareware or Adware.

Evaluation is based on categorization accuracy (Submission time will acts as a tie breaker). The submissions with the correct format and the highest accuracy will be declared the winners. We expect you to submit the submission csv file along with your code in the google forms that will be sent to the mail of your respective team lead. You can refer to the ```sample_submission.csv``` file for the proper file submission format. Incorrect formats will not be evaluated and hence be disqualified.
